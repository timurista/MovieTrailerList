# Movie Trailer List 
This project uses python files to create a list of movies with information about each movie. Clicking the image will show a movie and clicking "show cast" wil show a list of all actors and their roles below the movie tile.

To run this file, click on "Fresh tomatoes.html" and it will open in your browser.
There are CDN's to bootstrap and jquery but those are the only dependencies.

Note:
This file was compiled using python classes in media.py and python entertainment center to create movies with certain attributes including cast, release date, youtube trailer, title and other information.

Possible Updates:
Add more movies, have it dynamically pull more content information from IMBD.
